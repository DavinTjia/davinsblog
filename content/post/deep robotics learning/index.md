In this blog post, I would be going over some topics on deep reinforcement learning with focus on robotics learning. I would 
expect this to be spanned across a series of posts. The content of these posts is my takeaway and additional exploration 
on the topics taught in [CSE599 G1](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse599g/23wi/) at University of Washington
by [Abishek Gupta](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~abhgupta/). Abishek is such a great teacher and this is such a great 
class that I think it deserves documentation of some form. That is the motivations of this blog posts series. 

**Disclaimer**: if there is any error in this blog posts, it is entirely my mistakes and my misunderstanding, but not 
the results of the slides of the lectures or Abhishek Gupta's delivery. Please contact me if you have any concerns or 
questions about the content of this post. Thank you!
